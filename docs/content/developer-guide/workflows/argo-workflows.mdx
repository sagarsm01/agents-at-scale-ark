# Argo Workflows

[Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/) enables multi-step agent operations with parallel execution, conditional logic, and workflow visualization.

Charts that are preconfigured to enable Argo workflows on Ark are available so that you can rapidly build out use cases.

## Installation

This installs Argo in single-namespace mode within the Ark tenant namespace (typically `default` in development mode). Production installations will typically use a cross-tenant Argo operator with workflow execution distributed across Ark tenant namespaces.

Install via Helm, or for local development mode use `devspace`:

```bash
helm upgrade --install argo-workflows \
  oci://ghcr.io/mckinsey/agents-at-scale-ark/charts/argo-workflows

# Or for local development, use devspace:
cd services/argo-workflows
devspace dev

# Check status
kubectl get pods

# Port-forward to dashboard (this is done automatically when using devspace).
kubectl port-forward svc/argo-workflows-server 2746:2746
# Dashboard: http://localhost:2746
```

### With Minio Artifact Storage

Argo Workflows can use Minio for storing workflow artifacts like intermediate outputs, logs, and data files. This is useful for passing data between workflow steps or preserving workflow outputs.

To enable Minio artifact storage, first install the Minio Operator:

```bash
helm upgrade minio-operator operator \
  --install \
  --repo https://operator.min.io \
  --namespace minio-operator \
  --create-namespace \
  --version 7.1.1
```

Then enable Minio in the Argo Workflows chart:

```bash
helm upgrade --install argo-workflows \
  oci://ghcr.io/mckinsey/agents-at-scale-ark/charts/argo-workflows \
  --set minio.enabled=true

# Or for local development:
cd services/argo-workflows
devspace dev  # Select 'true' when prompted to enable Minio
```

When using `devspace dev`, you'll be prompted whether to enable Minio artifact storage. If enabled, DevSpace automatically installs the Minio Operator and tenant.

To uninstall:

```bash
# Uninstall a Helm installation.
helm uninstall argo-workflows

# Or purge if using devspace.
devspace purge
```

Note: by default, the Argo chart does NOT remove installed CRDs, so that user's data is not deleted unexpectedly (this behaviour is conventional for Kubernetes). This means that re-installing to a different namespace will cause a clash. If you need to remove Argo CRDs (such as `Workflow`, `WorkflowTemplate`) then run:

```bash
kubectl get crd -o name | grep argoproj.io | xargs kubectl delete
```

This will delete all workflows, templates, etc, from the cluster - do so with caution.

## Running Workflows

Start by creating a workflow or workflow template.

A sample template is provided that shows how to run Ark queries:

```bash
kubectl apply -f services/argo-workflows/samples/query-fanout-template.yaml
```

Open the Argo dashboard with at [`http://localhost:2746`](http://localhost:2746) and choose "Workflows > New Workflow > From Template > Query Fanout". The workflow will look something like this when running:

![Screenshot of the fanout workflow](./images/query-fanout-screenshot.png)

Workflows can also be run using the Argo CLI:

```bash
# List workflow templates if needed.
argo template list

# output:
# NAME
# query-fanout-template

# Run a workflow.
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/query-fanout-template \
  -p question="Describe how to monitor argo workflows from the command-line" \
  -p evaluator-model="default"

# Watch workflow progress
argo watch @latest

# View results, or status of all workflows.
argo logs @latest
argo list workflows
```

This workflow demonstrates how to run Ark and Argo operations:

1. Take input paramters
2. Lists Ark models
3. Fan-out a workflow into a step per model
4. Run Ark queries
5. Fan-in and evalate results (quality, token count, etc)

## Ark tools example

Another sample template, `ark-tools-template.yaml` provides a simple workflow for running Ark CLI commands in containers. The [`ark-tools`](/reference/utility-images#ark-tools) image includes the Ark CLI pre-installed, enabling workflows to query agents and capture results as workflow outputs.

```bash
kubectl apply -f services/argo-workflows/samples/ark-tools-template.yaml
```

Use this template to integrate Ark agent queries into your workflows without building custom containers.

## Troubleshooting

When you get errors or unexpected results:

```bash
# List workflows
kubectl get workflows

# View logs
argo logs @latest
```
