# Observability

Comprehensive observability is crucial for production agentic workloads. ARK provides integrated monitoring, tracing, and logging capabilities to help you understand and optimize your AI agent performance.

## OpenTelemetry Integration

ARK provides observability through OpenTelemetry integration, allowing you to monitor and trace all operations across the controller, execution engines and any other services. You can connect to any OpenTelemetry-compatible provider using standard environment variables.

Telemetry is enabled by setting the OpenTelemetry environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | OTLP endpoint URL | `http://localhost:4318/v1/traces` |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` | Authentication headers | `Authorization=Basic <token>` |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | Service name for telemetry | `ark-controller` |
| `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` | Additional resource attributes | `environment=production` |

## Architecture

Some queries go directly from the controller to the OTEL endpoint, while others flow through execution engines when multi-framework agent orchestration is used.

```
  OTEL Env Vars
┌─────────────────┐
│  ARK Controller │
└─────────┬───────┘
          │
          ├─── → Query Executor → OTEL Endpoint
          │
          └─── → Query Executor → Execution Engine → OTEL Endpoint
  OTEL Env Vars
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Services, Engines, etc  ├─── → OTEL Endpoint
└─────────────────────────┘
```



## Automatic Injection of OTEL Configuration

One way to set up automatic OpenTelemetry configuration is through standardized ConfigMap and Secret references. This pattern allows any Kubernetes resource to automatically pick up OTEL environment variables when available:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: your-app
        envFrom:
        # Standard OTEL configuration - will be injected if available
        - configMapRef:
            name: otel-environment-variables
            optional: true
        - secretRef:
            name: otel-environment-variables
            optional: true
```

When you create or update the standardized `otel-environment-variables` ConfigMap and Secret, all deployments and pods that reference them must be restarted to pick up the new environment variables:

```bash
# Restart components to pick up changes
kubectl rollout restart deployment/ark-controller -n ark-system
```

### Service Name Configuration

You can optionally set the service name used for telemetry in your containers, using the `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` variable:

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: your-app
        env:
        - name: OTEL_SERVICE_NAME
          value: "my-custom-service"
```

### Additional OTEL Variables

These OpenTelemetry environment variables are also supported:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` | Additional resource attributes | `environment=production,version=1.0` |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TIMEOUT` | Request timeout in milliseconds | `30000` |
| `OTEL_PROPAGATORS` | Trace context propagation format | `tracecontext,baggage` |
| `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER` | Sampling strategy | `always_on`, `always_off`, `traceidratio` |
| `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG` | Sampler configuration | `0.1` (for 10% sampling) |
