# Ark CLI Developer Guide

Conventions for developing the Ark CLI and commands. Ark provides two CLIs: **`ark`** (Node.js) for general-purpose interactive use with non-interactive mode for scripting, and **`fark`** (Go) optimized for resource management and low latency. Both are located in `tools/`.

## Design Conventions

Ark's CLI design draws from `kubectl` and `argo`, aiming to make the experience familiar for users.

Kubernetes `kubectl` provides resource-oriented operations:

```bash
kubectl get pods                    # List resources
kubectl get pods -o json            # JSON output
kubectl describe pod my-pod         # Detailed view
kubectl get pods --timeout=30s      # With timeout
```

Argo Workflows manages workflow execution and monitoring:

```bash
argo list                    # List workflows
argo list --running          # Filter by status
argo get my-workflow         # Get workflow details
argo logs my-workflow        # View logs
argo submit workflow.yaml    # Submit workflow (interactive by default)
argo list -o wide            # Extended output
```

Both use the default kubeconfig context for Kubernetes connections.

## Command Conventions

Global level commands can be created to manage the Ark platform - these commands should be created judiciously. They are interactive by default but can also be scripted.

```bash
ark install                  # Install platform (interactive)
ark install --yes            # Non-interactive (for scripts)
ark status                   # Check system health
ark dashboard                # Open dashboard
ark completion               # Shell completion
```

Resource level commands follow the pattern: `ark <resource> <action> [name] [options]`

```bash
# Resources: models, agents, teams, tools, evaluation
# Common verbs: list (default), create, status, query, delete, watch

ark models                          # List models
ark models create default           # Create model
ark agents query weather "msg"      # Query agent
ark models status default           # Check model health
```

Note: `watch` is not yet implemented but will likely be added soon.

Shorthand options can occasionally be offered if they provide clearer scripting or interactive syntax:

```bash
# Standard resource / verb / noun syntax.
ark models query default "What is 2+2?"

# Shorthand verb syntax, more natural for some of the more essential commands.
ark query model/default "What is 2+2?"

# Sorthand for calling evaluation
ark evaluation ark-evaluator --input "What is 2+2?" --output "5"

# Chaining query and evaluation example
ark query model/default "What is 2+2?" -o name | ark evaluation ark-evaluator
```

Note that the target format is `<type>/<name>` (e.g., `agent/weather`, `team/my-team`), as per the Ark APIs. Consider supporting `@latest` as a convenience alias for the most recently created resource, similar to `argo logs @latest`. This feature is not yet implemented but will likely be added soon.

## Parameter Conventions

Following kubectl/argo patterns. Essential parameters:

| Flag | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `-o, --output` | Output format (json, yaml, text) | `ark models -o json` |
| `--timeout` | Operation timeout | `ark agents query weather "msg" --timeout 30s` |
| `@latest` | Latest resource alias (planned) | `ark queries logs @latest` |

## Exit Code and Error Handling Conventions

Four main status codes are used:

| Code | Meaning | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `0` | Success | Command completed |
| `1` | CLI Error | Invalid arguments, config issues |
| `2` | Operation Error | Backend failure, resource error |
| `3` | Timeout | Operation exceeded time limit |

This helps scripts distinguish between usage errors, operational failures, timeouts, and evaluation failures. Error details are printed by the CLI.

Query operations return exit code `2` when execution fails and `3` on timeout, making error handling in scripts straightforward. This behavior aligns with Argo Workflows' `--wait` flag pattern (see [argoproj/argo-workflows#1008](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/1008)).

Example handling exit codes:

```bash
if ! ark agents query weather "What's the weather?"; then
   echo "Query failed with exit code $?"
fi
```

## Output Conventions

### Tables

Text format output (`-o text`) uses tables with the following structure:

- Column headers in uppercase
- Data rows below the header
- Columns separated by 2 blank spaces

Status values use color coding to convey state information:

- <span style={{color:'green'}}>Green</span> indicates successful completion
- <span style={{color:'blue'}}>Blue</span> indicates in-progress operations
- <span style={{color:'red'}}>Red</span> indicates errors or failures
- <span style={{color:'yellow'}}>Yellow</span> indicates pending or undefined states

Example table output:

<pre>
<code>
NAME     DESCRIPTION          STATUS
entry-1  entry description 1  <span style={{color:'green'}}>success</span>
entry-2  entry description 2  <span style={{color:'blue'}}>running</span>
entry-3  entry description 3  <span style={{color:'red'}}>fail</span>
entry-4  entry description 4  <span style={{color:'yellow'}}>initializing</span>
</code>
</pre>

Empty tables are highlighted with a warning message:

<pre>
<code>
<span style={{color:'yellow'}}>! warning:</span> no entries found
</code>
</pre>


## Interactive Conventions

Colors and progress indicators are enabled by default in interactive terminals and automatically disabled when output is piped, `NO_COLOR` is set, or running in non-TTY environments. Default output is human-readable text. Use `-o json` for machine-readable output.

Ark uses [`chalk`](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) for terminal colors and [`ora`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ora), which automatically respect TTY and non-TTY environments.

The `ark chat` offers full interactive experience inspired by Claude Code, and uses [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink).

## Debugging Conventions

Enable debug logging using the `DEBUG` environment variable. The Node.js [`debug` module](https://github.com/debug-js/debug) is used:

```bash
# Enable all ark debug output
DEBUG=ark:* ark status
```
