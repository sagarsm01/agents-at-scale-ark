# Agent

Agents are the core execution units in ARK. They process inputs using AI models and can use tools to extend their capabilities.

## Specification

```yaml
apiVersion: ark.mckinsey.com/v1alpha1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: example-agent
spec:
  # Agent's system prompt that defines its behavior
  prompt: |
    You are a helpful assistant.
    
  # Human-readable description
  description: General-purpose assistant agent
  
  # Model reference (optional - defaults to 'default' if not specified)
  modelRef:
    name: gpt-4-model
    namespace: default
    
  # Execution engine (optional - uses built-in OpenAI-compatible engine if not specified)
  executionEngine:
    name: langchain-engine
    namespace: default
    
  # Tools the agent can use
  tools:
    - type: built-in  # System-provided tools (web-search, calculations)
      name: web-search
    - type: custom   # References to Tool or MCPServer resources
      name: my-custom-tool
      
  # Parameters for template processing in prompts
  parameters:
    - name: api_endpoint
      valueFrom:
        configMapKeyRef:
          name: config
          key: endpoint
    - name: agent_name
      valueFrom:
        queryParameterRef:
          name: agent_name
          
  # JSON schema for structured output (optional)
  outputSchema:
    type: object
    properties:
      summary:
        type: string
      confidence:
        type: number

  # Header overrides for models and MCP servers (optional)
  overrides:
    - headers:
        - name: X-User-ID
          value:
            value: "user123"
      resourceType: model
      labelSelector:
        matchLabels:
          provider: openai

status:
  # Status conditions indicate agent health and availability
  conditions:
  - type: Available
    status: "True"
    reason: AllDependenciesReady
    message: Agent is ready for execution
```

## Status and Conditions

Agents use status conditions to indicate their availability and health:

### Conditions

| Condition Type | Status | Description |
|----------------|--------|-------------|
| **Available** | True | Agent is ready for execution with all dependencies resolved |
| **Available** | False | Agent has unresolved dependencies or configuration issues |

### Status Fields

```yaml
status:
  conditions:
  - type: Available
    status: "True"
    reason: AllDependenciesReady
    message: Agent is ready for execution
```

kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: my-agent
spec:
  tools:
    - type: custom
      name: weather-forecast  # Name exposed to Agent
      description: "Get latest weather forecast"  # Description exposed to Agent
      partial:
        name: weather-api  # Actual Tool CRD name
        parameters:
          - name: city
            value: "{{ .Query.city }}"  # From query parameters
          - name: units

          - name: language
            value: nil  # Explicitly exclude parameter to be provided by Agent
```



### A2A Agent (Created by A2AServer)

Agents created by [A2AServer](/reference/resources/a2aserver) resources use the A2A execution engine:

```yaml
apiVersion: ark.mckinsey.com/v1alpha1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: aws-operator-agent
  annotations:
    # A2A server that created this agent
    ark.mckinsey.com/a2a-server-name: aws-operator-agent
    # Resolved address of the A2A server
    ark.mckinsey.com/a2a-server-address: http://ark-agentcore-bridge.default.svc.cluster.local:80/a2a/agent/aws_operator_agent-jg0yD9Hv2n
    # Skills discovered from the A2A server
    ark.mckinsey.com/a2a-server-skills: '[{"name":"describe_ec2_instances","description":"List and describe EC2 instances"}]'
spec:
  description: AWS operations agent with read-only access to AWS services
  prompt: You are aws_operator_agent. AWS operations agent with read-only access to AWS services
  executionEngine:
    name: a2a
  # modelRef omitted - A2A agents don't require models by default
  # If the underlying A2A server uses an ARK model, the agent can optionally link to it via modelRef.
  # When modelRef is set, the agent will only show as Available if both the model and A2A server are available.
  # Otherwise, only the A2A server availability is checked.
```

## Reconciliation Behavior

The agent controller continuously reconciles agent resources to ensure dependencies are met:

### Model Resolution

1. **Model Reference**: Controller validates the specified model exists in agent's namespace
2. **Model not found**: Agent status condition "Available" is set to False with warning event
3. **A2A Agents**: Agents owned by A2AServer resources do not require a model reference

### Tool Resolution

1. **Custom tools**: Controller validates each custom tool exists in agent's namespace
2. **Built-in tools**: No validation needed (always available)
3. **Tool not found**: Agent status condition "Available" is set to False with warning event

### Dependency Watching

The controller watches for changes to:
- **Models**: When a model is created/updated, reconciles all dependent agents
- **Tools**: When a tool is created/updated, reconciles all agents using that tool

This ensures agents automatically become Available when missing dependencies are resolved.
