# Team

Teams coordinate multiple agents working together using different execution strategies.

## Specification

```yaml
apiVersion: ark.mckinsey.com/v1alpha1
kind: Team
metadata:
  name: example-team
spec:
  # Team members - agents or nested teams
  members:
    - name: researcher
      type: agent
    - name: analyst
      type: agent
    - name: writer
      type: agent

  # Turn limit (optional) - prevents infinite loops
  maxTurns: 10

  # Execution strategy - how members collaborate
  strategy: selector  # Options: sequential, round-robin, selector, graph

  # Selector configuration - for strategy: selector
  selector:
    agent: planner  # Agent to use for selection (required)
    selectorPrompt: "Choose the best agent for: {{.Input}}"  # Optional

  # Graph constraints (optional) - can be combined with selector strategy
  # When combined with selector, limits AI selection to valid graph transitions
  graph:
    edges:
      - from: researcher
        to: analyst
      - from: analyst
        to: writer

  # # Round-robin configuration - for strategy: round-robin
  # strategy: round-robin
  # # No additional configuration needed

  # # Sequential configuration - for strategy: sequential
  # strategy: sequential
  # # No additional configuration needed

  # # Graph-only configuration - for strategy: graph
  # strategy: graph
  # graph:
  #   edges:
  #     - from: researcher
  #       to: analyst
  #     - from: analyst
  #       to: writer
```

## Execution Strategies

Execution strategies define how team members are chosen during query execution.

- **sequential** - Agents process input one after another
- **round-robin** - Agents take turns processing inputs
- **selector** - Dynamic agent selection based on criteria, LLM chooses the next agent for the job
- **graph** - Custom execution flows with edges, supports more complex workflows
- **selector + graph** - Combines AI-driven selection with workflow constraints (selector agent chooses from graph-defined valid transitions)

## Turn Limiting

The optional `maxTurns` field prevents infinite loops by limiting execution turns. When reached, the team completes successfully with all accumulated responses.

- **round-robin** - Limits total agent messages (e.g., 3 agents, `maxTurns: 5` = 5 messages total)
- **selector** - Limits selection rounds (each round = one agent selection and execution)
- **graph** - Limits edge traversals through the execution graph
- **sequential** - Not applicable (naturally terminates after all agents complete)

When `maxTurns` is reached:

1. Team execution stops gracefully
2. All responses generated up to the limit are returned
3. Warning event emitted: `TeamMaxTurnsReached`
4. Query completes successfully (not an error)
